# Microservices

This is designed to be a workspace for a series of workshops and/or exercises
aimed at working through concepts in the book [Building Microservices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do).

The goal for each topic would be to provide some examples of code and tools, and
environments to play and experiment with. Each topic listed below is covered in the
book to some degree.

One way to setup example environments could be with
Docker, as shown [here](https://github.com/kevinbuch/ops-stuff).

## Topics

- Implementing the circuit breaker and bulkhead pattern.
  See [Hytrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) for concepts and implementation.

- Logging and instrumentation patterns in services.
  See [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/0.9.2/docs/) for concepts and implementation.

- Log aggregation with ELK stack.

- RabbitMQ patterns and anti-patterns.

- Service discovery. What is it. How it works.

- Build pipeline setup. Maybe with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)

- Deploy process.

- Caching.

- Monitoring. [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/)

- Security. (SSO and such)
